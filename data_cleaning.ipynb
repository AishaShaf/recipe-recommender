This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  \\nIn a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.  \\nHow long is the process?  5 days, from start to finish.

A great alternative to a baked potato when served with grilled steak or chicken. I belive this recipe could be made with instant grits.The 2 1/2 hours for refrigeration is not include in time.

I've tweaked it a bit over the years.  It fills the house with an amazing aroma and tastes as good as it smells.  This takes a while to make, so I often do it on a weekend afternoon and then reheat it later in the week. Although the recipe calls for dried sour cherries, I have also made it with dried bings.   \n",

I'm only 12 (by the way I'm using my mom's account) and I LOVE to create, cook, bake,and eat! I think this would be a great after-school snack for your kids (it's super quick) or just a tasty uplifting treat when your day has been yucky. Hope you like! please give me some suggestions!!! :)   \n",

It is so awesome, I can't think of a single modification....it is perfect.  It is more time consuming than most tortilla soups because of the roasted veggies, but it is totally worth it.  If you wanted to go vegetarian, leave out the chicken, there is so much to this soup it would be great that way.   \n",

The prawns are optional for vegetarian but if you eat fish please add them!  This is sooo fantastic! Serve with crusty bread or crudites or pretzels!

Plantains are those big bananas in the supermarket. Often used in Caribbean cooking. They are a starch and must be cooked before eating. In this recipe they are an alternative to mashed potatoes. The original recipe basically had more  butter and sour cream. Increase those if you want a richer dish.   \n",
       "18  Those of you who had the pleasure of growing up on the East Coast of the United States may have had one of these traditional Kosher pickles, made primarily by Jewish businesses. They are by no means your store bought pickles.  They are even better then your favorite deli's pickles.  These pickles are what all other pickles are founded on; quality.  \\nDO NOT be scared of making pickles.  This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  \\nIn a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.  \\nHow long is the process?  5 days, from start to finish.  Too many for you?  Then its time to move on.  Want a fantastic, authentic, Kosher/Jewish pickles?  You have found your recipe.  \\nLet us begin.\\n\\nP.S.  The jar. I get my jar(s) by buying a big jar of crap pickles from a food warehouse.  Then I wash it and pour some boiling water in it, and it is ready for use.  I also boil the cap just in case, but have made many batches without ever using boiling water and I have never taken ill.  Only reason I do use the boiling water on occasion is because my wife is around.   \n",

Desparation leads to inspiration and this was the result. A soupy chili with a complex flavor that is part spicy and smokey with slightly sweet undertones from the pineapple.  Since this was a pantry clearing experiment, you should feel free to do the same.  Replace the pink beans with kidney beans or use red peppers instead of green ones.   \n",

Use 3 T. flax seed meal mixed with 1 T. water for egg-free preparation (as noted in the ingredients). Gluten free pasta is available, but because I'm severely vitamin D deficient as a result of Celiac Disease which went undiagnosed for many years, I came up with this in order to take advantage of the vitamin D in mushrooms. The cheese and pasta sauce are the two critical ingredients that will make or break this dish. We have two sauces created by local restaurants that are available in many Ohio grocery stores: LaRosa's and Annarino's. They tie for first place as the best all-purpose sauce I've ever tasted. You might consider looking in your area for a good locally produced sauce ... but maybe we're just really lucky around here! I use Mario Batali Italian Four Cheese Blend because it's outstanding and loaded with flavor.   \n",

The best Chicago pizzas usually feature cornbread crusts, but the pie crusts make a surprisingly tasty substitute!  I use this recipe by Dan-Amer #1 for the sausage (http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-bulk-italian-sausage-chicago-style-329000), but store-bought sausage should work just as well.   \n",

Easy to make and very much appreciated by all. Perfect for Eid celebrations or any special (or not so special!) ocassion.\\n\\nThis is for the lemon ones - more traditionally they are lime....\\n\\nYou can freeze these and then put the syrup and icing sugar on later. I like to make a few things in advance so I'm not cooking 24/7 just before Eid etc. I also make these with a mix of 250g desiccated coconut + 100g ground almonds - just as tasty & a fraction of the cost!   \n",
