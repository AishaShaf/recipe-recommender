       "4  This is a fabulous stew that came from one of the Seattle Junior League cookbooks.  I've tweaked it a bit over the years.  It fills the house with an amazing aroma and tastes as good as it smells.  This takes a while to make, so I often do it on a weekend afternoon and then reheat it later in the week. Although the recipe calls for dried sour cherries, I have also made it with dried bings.   \n",
